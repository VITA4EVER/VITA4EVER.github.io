title: New Website Created!
date: 2020-11-11

Hey there! We decided to create a new website dedicated to VITA4EVER, since the old one is not ideal. 

The problem is, I lost the website files, so I had to come up with a "new-new" website.

This new-new website will follow minimalistic design patterns, and will use Nuxt Content for it's feed.
At the moment of this website creation, an RSS feed is unavailable, but we might add it later on.

I'm thinking of **improving** the communication between the game and community (G2C), by utilizing "Jeremy", our Discord bot, to showcase game stats and more.

This will take some time to get completely done, so make sure you're following the #news channel on Discord!

I want to also point out that I have been absent for some time lately, for *personal* reasons, so I apologize for that.

I might not be available on Discord for several reasons, please take note that everything is alright on my side.
